## Log

### R1D1 [August 28, Wednesday, 2019]
I'm taking a break from FreeCodeCamp "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification" and try to compliment the learned lessons with building small Apps. My first try is a basic Tetris App to learn more about how "Canvas" in HTML work. I spent a lot of time debugging, googling and looking up at a tutorial when I got stuck. But I was able to finish it at the end.
I've used this tutorial as a guidance: https://www.codeexplained.org/2018/08/create-tetris-game-using-javascript.html

Used Technology:
- Javascript
- HTML5

Learnt Lessons:
- do less typos (variables, brackets)
- isolate potential problems
