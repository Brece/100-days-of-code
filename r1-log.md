## Log

### R1D1 [August 28, Wednesday, 2019]
I'm taking a break from FreeCodeCamp "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification" and try to compliment the learned lessons with building small Apps. My first try is a basic Tetris App to learn more about how "Canvas" in HTML work. I spent a lot of time debugging, googling and looking up at a tutorial when I got stuck. But I was able to finish it at the end.
I've used this tutorial as a guidance: https://www.codeexplained.org/2018/08/create-tetris-game-using-javascript.html

Used Technology:
- Javascript/HTML5

Learnt Lessons:
- do less typos (variables, brackets)
- isolate potential problems

### R1D2 [August 29, Wednesday, 2019]
Today I tried to build a To-Do app with a tutorial as a guidance. Eventhough I had to look up a lot of documentation I will come back and re-read it step by step. There was a lot of information about DOM manipulation and how to use JSON.

Used Technology:
- Javascript/HTML5/CSS

Learnt Lessons:
- DOM manipulation
- JSON/local storage

### R1D3 [August 30, Friday, 2019]
Today I went through the To-Do app from yesterday and read the documentations. I also refreshed my knowlegde of HTML/CSS and started the advanced section on https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/ and played around on a Test site.
