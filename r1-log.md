## Log

### R1D1 [August 28, Wednesday, 2019]
I'm taking a break from FreeCodeCamp "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification" and try to compliment the learned lessons with building small Apps. My first try is a basic Tetris App to learn more about how "Canvas" in HTML work. I spent a lot of time debugging, googling and looking up at a tutorial when I got stuck. But I was able to finish it at the end.
I've used this tutorial as a guidance: https://www.codeexplained.org/2018/08/create-tetris-game-using-javascript.html

Used Technology:
- Javascript/HTML5

Learnt Lessons:
- do less typos (variables, brackets)
- isolate potential problems

### R1D2 [August 29, Wednesday, 2019]
Today I tried to build a To-Do app with a tutorial as a guidance. Eventhough I had to look up a lot of documentation I will come back and re-read it step by step. There was a lot of information about DOM manipulation and how to use JSON.

Used Technology:
- Javascript/HTML5/CSS

Learnt Lessons:
- DOM manipulation
- JSON/local storage

### R1D3 [August 30, Friday, 2019]
Today I went through the To-Do app from yesterday and read the documentations. I also refreshed my knowlegde of HTML/CSS and started the advanced section on https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/ and played around on a Test site.



### R1D4 [August 31, Saturday, 2019]
Today I decided to stick to the "Full Stack JavaScript" track of The Odin Project. I may continue FreeCodeCamp in the future. But for now I realized that the handholding on FCC is counter-productive for my progression. 


### R1D5 [September 1, Sunday, 2019]
Today I set up the Linux environment on my laptop, learnt some terminal commands and played around with it. Next I'm going to set up my Git account and learn the basics. Right now I'm lacking the necessary skills how to use the terminal and version control programs.
