The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 28, Wednesday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 [August 28, Wednesday, 2019]

I'm taking a break from FreeCodeCamp "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification" and try to compliment the learned lessons with building small Apps. My first try is a basic Tetris App to learn more about how "Canvas" in HTML work. I spent a lot of time debugging, googling and looking up at a tutorial when I got stuck. But I was able to finish it at the end.
I've used this tutorial as a guidance: https://www.codeexplained.org/2018/08/create-tetris-game-using-javascript.html

Used Technology:

- Javascript/HTML5

Learnt Lessons:

- do less typos (variables, brackets)
- isolate potential problems

### R1D2 [August 29, Thursday, 2019]

Today I tried to build a To-Do app with a tutorial as a guidance. Eventhough I had to look up a lot of documentation I will come back and re-read it step by step. There was a lot of information about DOM manipulation and how to use JSON.

Used Technology:

- Javascript/HTML5/CSS

Learnt Lessons:

- DOM manipulation
- JSON/local storage

### R1D3 [August 30, Friday, 2019]

Today I went through the To-Do app from yesterday and read the documentations. I also refreshed my knowlegde of HTML/CSS and started the advanced section on https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/ and played around on a Test site.

### R1D4 [August 31, Saturday, 2019]

Today I decided to stick to the "Full Stack JavaScript" track of The Odin Project. I may continue FreeCodeCamp in the future. But for now I realized that the handholding on FCC is counter-productive for my progression.

### R1D5 [September 1, Sunday, 2019]

Today I set up the Linux environment on my laptop, learnt some terminal commands and played around with it. Next I'm going to set up my Git account and learn the basics. Right now I'm lacking the necessary skills how to use the terminal and version control programs.

### R1D6 [September 2, Monday, 2019]

As planned I spent my time today learning the workflow with Git and get more comfortable with the command line following "Web-Development-101" of The Odin Project.

### R1D7 [September 3, Tuesday, 2019]

Today I progressed with The Odin Project Curriculum and finished the assignments for Git and the first one for HTML&CSS while getting used to the Git commands.

### R1D8 [September 4, Wednesday, 2019]

Today I finished the (easy) assignment of https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav
I faced a few problems with floating nav-bar elements and learned a lot about Grid, Flexbox, align and justify contents, hover effects, adjusting margins/borders and using developer tool for quick adjustments. It was pretty basic stuff but I managed to find the solutions on my own instead of cheating with the source code.

### R1D9 [September 5, Thursday, 2019]

Today I started the difficult version of the assignment "Google Homepage" using only HTML&CSS to look like this:
https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage

I've got the feeling that my CSS code is kind of messy. But right now it "just have look similar". I might revisit my projects in the future and try to accomplish the outcome with less CSS code.

### R1D10 [September 6, Friday, 2019]

Today I was working on my assignment from previous days. I looked up how to use Grid and FlexBox in HTML&CSS. I'm still not comfortable with it. My layout keeps braking since I don't have a general overview how to structure my site properly. Most of the time I'm trying to generate the objects one by one. There's a long way to go.

### R1D11 [September 7, Saturday, 2019]

Today I almost finished the project. Some minor details are still missing but I'm not going to waste my time any longer on it. Right now I lack the knowledge how to manipulate or create Icons on my own.
The CSS Reset makes it a bit difficult to style everything from scratch. But this is the way I chose. Better learn it right now at the beginning than struggling in the future.

### R1D12 [September 8, Sunday, 2019]
